### General

- Added Travis CI support.
- Added `--test` which prints all functions.
- Cleanup of Distro, Uptime, Memory and CPU functions.
- We now use a more reliable whitespace trimming substitution for CPU/GPU etc.
- Use `stty` instead of `read -s` to fix an issue with escape sequences<br \>
appearing in the output.
- Line wrap is now disabled by default.
- Implement base support for caching specific info. This will eventually<br \>
allow us to speed up the script by caching info that won't change for a<br \>
long period of time like the CPU/GPU. \[1\]
- Fixed a locale issue when `LC_ALL` is unset on the user's system.

\[1\] You can clear the cache with `--clean`.
