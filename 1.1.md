# Fetch 1.1 changelog

- If `w3m` or `imagemagick` aren't installed we gracefully fallback to ascii mode.
- Automatically find the `w3mimgdisplay` path and fallback to ascii mode if not found.
- Fix padding escape codes on BSD systems.
- Swap escape codes from `\e` to `\033` for consistency.
- We only move the cursor to the bottom of the terminal in w3m/iterm2 rendering modes.
- Cursor position is now dynamic based on the height of the ascii and info text.
- If images and ascii are off, don't clear the terminal
- The script now exits correctly instead of always exiting with status code `1`

### Config file

- Fetch now has a config file that you can share with people and<br \>
keep between script versions!
- Added `--config` and `$config_file` to specify a custom config location.
- Added `--config off`, `--config none` and `$config` to enable / disable config files<br \>
at launch or in script.


### Makefile

- Fetch now has a make file due to the increasing number of files,<br \>
this allows the script to be easily installed and uninstalled on<br \>
systems it isn't packaged for yet!
