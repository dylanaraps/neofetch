# Fetch 1.3

### Image

- You no longer need to set the font_width value, your font size<br \>
is now calculated by fetch.
- Image sizing now takes terminal height into account.
- `--size` now also takes a percentage as a value, for example.

```sh
# Image takes up 70% of the terminal size.
fetch --size 70%
```

### OS

- Added support for `BunsenLabs`.

### Info

- Don't display Theme, Icons, Font or Window Manager if X isn't running.

**Song**<br \>
- Added `song_shorthand` which prints the Artist/Title on seperate lines.

**Theme**<br\>
- Windows Visual Style is now a part of `getstyle`.
- Disabled theme output on OS X to fix a `gsetttings` related crash.

### Stdout

Printing to stdout in a plaintext format for use in scripts is now<br \>
much faster and cleaner.

- Removed `--stdout_separator` (Separator is now 2 spaces)
- Removed `--stdout_subtitles`
- Removed `--stdout_title`
